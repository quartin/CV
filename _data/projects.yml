  description: Before the 2019 Portuguese Legislative elections, I paired with another Talkdesk Data Scientist and used some of the text mining techniques we were exploring and using at Talkdesk to extract insights about the parties' manifestos. This experiment resulted in a couple of blog posts (portuguese only) and a talk at a Geek Girls Portugal meetup, in October 2019.

This package makes it easier to add a script to the middle of an existing workflow without the need to manually renumber all the scripts.'
